# Design decisions

On the one hand state of the art should be used, on the other hand as many browsers as possible should be supported.

â†’ Support browsers that support Flexbox ([98.74%](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)):
Chrome 21, Internet Explorer 10, Firefox 22, Android Browser 21, etc. and higher

See:
* [Browser support](https://caniuse.com/)
* Tutorial/specification: [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/default.asp), [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
* JavaScript minifiers:

## General layout (CSS): [`Flexbox`](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp) ([tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), [98.74%](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox))

* Instead of `float`, layout via tables (both are deprecated for that) and `gridx` (since it is too new and not yet widely supported)
* TODO Add fallback for IE 6-9 (see [Flexbox Fallbacks](http://maddesigns.de/flexbox-fallbacks-2670.html))
